## ❖ About

InRequiem Lab is a quiet collective focused on crafting tools, insights, and systems that live between thought and execution.

We build and maintain frameworks for understanding complexity — in data, behavior, and machines.  

---

## ❖ Focus

We work across disciplines, guided by curiosity and precision.

- Quantitative Research & Modeling  
- Telemetry & Signal Processing  
- AI Systems & Applied LLMs  
- Autonomous Agents & Decision Layers  
- Experimental Software & Interfaces  
- Human-in-the-loop Simulation & Design

---

## ❖ Team

- **Collaborators** — Researchers, engineers, and dreamers who don't really sleep

We operate loosely, often asynchronously.  
We don't micromanage innovation.

---

## ❖ Contribution

We accept contributions from those who respect the process.

- Fork and build quietly.  
- Document clearly.  
- Submit with intent.  
- We’ll review what feels aligned.

No theatrics. Just meaningful work.
